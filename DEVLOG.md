# Welcome to my personal project

## Quick rundown
There is both a frontend and backend folder however the main pupose of this 
project is the backend. While I have every intention of fully finihsing this 
project the vast majority of the time will be learning API functionalilty.

## Frontend
The frontend has not been touched as of yet, however, once I get to it, the 
theme will be a reailty website as the website is for my friend's realty 
business. 

## The backend
The backend went through a few stages of changes and follows modern ideaoligies
such as JWT tokens and password hashing. For a more in depth look at the 
progress please see the README located in the backend folder.
