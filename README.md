# Welcome to my personal project

## Overview
This is a full-stack project with both a frontend and backend, 
though the primary focus is on building and learning backend functionality, 
specifically working with APIs, JWT authentication, and other modern backend practices.

## Frontend
The frontend hasn't been started yet. Once development begins, it will serve 
as the website for a friend‚Äôs realty business, with a sleek, modern real estate design.

üõ†Ô∏è Backend
The backend has undergone a few redesigns and now follows up-to-date practices like:

- JWT-based authentication

- Password hashing

- RESTful API structure

More detailed documentation and setup instructions can be found in: 
backend/README.md (Not yet made).
